EVERYONE:
REMEMBER, BLOGS AND POSTS ARE DIFFERENT!

EBULLER:
11/3
work on: 

11/2
work on: crt_blog.html 
note: currently creates a blog with text directly inside, should have option for...
- blog name
- first post name
- text for first post

TFAHEY:
11/3



work on: edit_blog.html, homepage.html
note:
- needs to be able to chose which blog to edit, and then which post IN that blog to edit
- - you can keep the page as it is, just change blog selection to post selection, but then if you know
how the dropdown menus work, add a dropdown for the edit_blog button on the homepage
- not sure why but footer only appears when you click the "choose blog" dropdown menu
- - this might be an indenting issue

IMIJACIKA:
work on: view_blogs.html
- should choose a blog to view and then view posts in that blog
- instead of making them choose a user, then a blog, can just make selection from big 
masterlist of blogs with users in ()

AALONSO:
work on: homepage.html, new_post_old_blog.html, __init__.py
- homepage.html should be better formatted
- maybe split __init__.py into other py files for each function, use __init__ as a wrapper
- update design.pdf with updates
- new_post_old_blog is for exactly what it sounds like, as that is our missing functionality at the moment
